Who It's For (Concrete Examples)
Content Architects
"Turn your unique research → outline → revision process into reusable templates that outlive any '10x ChatGPT prompt' list"

"Automate personalized learning paths where each student interaction improves the system for everyone"

Solopreneurs
"Package your decision-making frameworks (how you vet ideas/pick niches/validate markets) as sellable AI tools"

Analysts
"Build self-improving research systems where each report teaches the next analysis to be sharper"

Imagination Gap
"Teams that can't turn institutional knowledge into AI systems will be outpaced"

Economic Shift
"The next wave of businesses will sell process-as-product"
